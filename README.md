# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. There are many like it, but this one is mine!

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students like me forked and cloned the original repository here (https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/tweeter), then built upon it to practice our HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and our Node, Express back-end skills.

## Getting Started with my Tweeter.

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
5. Make a few tweets, open dev tools, and have a look around!
